1 Introduction to Angular Material
=====================

1.1. What is Material Design
---------------------

Material Design is a `User Interface design language created by Google in 2014`. It dictates a set of principles and guidelines for creating UIs including motion (animations) and interaction (gestures).

1.2. What is Angular Material
---------------------

- Angular Material is a UI component library for Angular developers (Material Design components for Angular)
- Angular Material is the implementation of Material Design for Angular. It offers a set of components and patterns for navigation, forms, buttons, and layouts
- Angular Material is a library of re-usable and high-quality UI components built with Angular and TypeScript
- The angular Material library provides us with the component to build awesome user interface/look and feel in quick time
- It an implementation of Google's Material Design specification and standards (Just like we have UI frameworks for following famous and popular frameworks):
  - **`ReactJs`** -> MaterialUI
  - **`VueJs`** -> Vuetify
  - **`Angular`** -> Angular Material

| **Framework**                     | **UI Component Library**                  |
| ----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **`ReactJs`**                     | MaterialUI                                |
| **`VueJs`**                       | Vuetify                                   |
| **`Angular`**                     | Angular Material                          |

> Current major version of Angular and Angular Material is version 7 / 8

1.3. Benefits of Angular Material
---------------------
There are several benefits of using Angular Material components. Angular Material Components are:
- Internationalized (Worldwide user with different languages can use)
- Clean and simple API
- Well testing with Unit and Integration test
- Easily Customizable
- Theme based (various themes available)
- Very fast (minimal performance overhead)
- Well-documented
- Community support
- Constructing attractive, consistent, and functional web pages and web applications 
- Follow/Adhere to modern web design principles like browser portability, device independence, and graceful degradation

1.4. Features of Angular Material 
---------------------

- In-built responsive designing
- Cross-browser compatibility 
- Can be used to create reusable web components
- Includes new versions of common UI controls/components such as buttons, checkboxes, and text fields, etc. 
- Adapted to Material Design concepts/principles
- Includes enhanced/specialized features like cards, toolbar, speed dial, side nav, swipe, and so on

1.5. Difference Between Angular Material and Bootstrap
---------------------
1.5. Angular Material vs Bootstrap
---------------------
In an application, one can use UI library/framework as Angular Material or Bootstrap or maybe both together as per needs and requirements

| **Angular Material**              | **Bootstrap**                             |
| ----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| New in the market(recently develop and introduced)                            | Old UI layout framework                                                                |
| Consists of fewer components as compared to Bootstrap                          | Consists of many useful components                                              |
| Angular Material is specially built for Angular, so it is standard framework/UI library used in all Google applications     | Bootstrap is not specially built for Angular so Bootstrap with Angular has lots of third party dependencies which may break any time |
| Angular Material components are built with Angular/TypeScript/JavaScript| Bootstrap is built/developed with plain JavaScript and jQuery. `Bootstrap UI` library is developed with Angular, and used especially for Angular Development    | 
| Common API, Ease to use and standard look and feel for various components| It have a different layout and different standards of look and feel |
| Good to use but not completely stable, as new component development is in progress | Stable |

2 Getting Started with Angular Material
=====================

2.1. Installing Angular Material
---------------------
2.1. Angular Material Environment Setup
---------------------

To install Angular and Angular Material, we require the following:

- Nodejs
- Npm
- Angular CLI
- Visual Code Editor, or an IDE for writing your code

<hr/>

> Its advisable to follow and keep open updated Angular Material guide/help document while implementing any component in an application: 
  - https://material.angular.io/guide
  - https://material.angular.io/guide/getting-started

<hr/>

> First Check Node/NPM, Angular CLI installed version by using the following command: 
```
ng -v 

or 

ng --version

```

<hr/>

> In this tutorial, we'll see how to add Material Design to Angular project/application  in two different ways: ( There are a different set of Material installation processes for Angular/Angular CLI 4+ versions and Angular 6+)

  1. `The manual or long way`: Install and add all dependencies by following a bunch of steps manually. This works for Angular 4+ versions

  2. `The short or quick way`: By using the `ng add` command to easily/quickly add Angular Material in one step using Angular Schematics. This method only works with Angular 6+ versions

> Its good to have and use Angular CLI version 7 and above installed on your machine (so if Angular CLI version 6 or lower available, please upgrade to Angular CLI version 7)
